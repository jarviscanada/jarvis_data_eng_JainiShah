# Python Data Analytics Project

## Introduction

To improve a business's operations, I was assigned to look into the company's transaction data and analyze their customers' shopping behaviour, and determine how the business can go about in their targeting marketing campaign. I used Python as my main language for analyzing the data. I also used Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and SQLAlchemy. All my work was done in a Jupyter notebook, and the data was accessed either their given CSV file or Postgres database, which ultimately came from their data warehouse.
