The program was written with the help of IntelliJ and searches patterns recursively in a given directory that stores the matched lines to an output file. Stream and lambda expressions were used for the efficient search through the directories and files. slf4j was used to log messages. The Java grep app was packaged using maven and dockerized so that users can easily consume it."
