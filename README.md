**Linux Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JainiShah/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Cluster Monitoring Agent using Bash to collect the hardware specifications of each node in a cluster and monitor resosurce usages every minute with the help of Crontab.The data is collected and stored to a PostgreSQL server which runs inside a docker container.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JainiShah/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - JDBC App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - Grep App: Implemented a JavaGrep interface to perform function same as grep command in linux. The program was written with the help of IntelliJ which searches pattern recursively in a given directory and stores the matched lines to output file. For the efficient search through the directories and files, stream and lambda expression is used and slf4j to log messages. The Java grep app was packaged using maven and dockerized so that users can easily consume it.
